# Collaborative-Lego-Building-with-Baxter 

Established a collaborative task of Lego building with Baxter robot and human friend. Determined the robot workspace using Baxter's hand 
camera. The lego blocks were then placed one by one for the robot to learn its position and orientation in an orderly fashion. 
A memory map of the lego structure was created. The robot then executed the process of building the same lego structure by picking
and placing the blocks using visual servoing technique. The human interference was also taken into consideration by the robot waiting for
the human to complete his task and also checking for any potential changes made in the lego block placement. 
Accordingly it executes the subsequent steps by examining the memory map.
